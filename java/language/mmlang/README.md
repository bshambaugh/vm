# mm-lang: An mm-ADT Assembly Language

mm-lang is a simple human readable/writable assembly language that is near 1-to-1 correspondence with the machine
readable/writable mm-ADT bytecode specification. This language can be used as an intermediate representation for
higher-level languages wanting to transpile to a text-based format vs. compiling to the binary format.
This language serves as a reference implementation for language designers developing an mm-ADT compiler.
