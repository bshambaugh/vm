http://mm-adt.org[mm-ADT] is a dual licensed https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt[AGPL3]/commercial open source project that offers software engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and others in the software industry a royalty-based OSS model.
The Turing Complete mm-ADT virtual machine (VM) integrates disparate data technologies via algebraic composition, yielding _synthetic data systems_ that have the requisite computational power and expressivity for the problems they were designed to solve.
As an economic model, each integration point offers the respective development team access to the revenue streams generated by any for-profit organization leveraging mm-ADT.

The mm-ADT VM is the integration point for the following data processing technologies:

* *Programming Languages*: Language designers can create custom languages or develop parsers for existing languages that compile to mm-ADT VM bytecode (binary machine code) or unicode (text assembly code).
* *Processing Engines*: Processor developers enable their push- or pull-based execution engines to be programmed by any mm-ADT language for evaluation via mm-ADT's abstract execution model for processing data structures via single-machine, multi-threaded, agent-based, distributed near-time, and/or cluster-oriented, batch-analytic processors.
* *Storage Systems*: Storage engineers can embed their systems using _model-ADTs_ expressed in mm-ADT's dependent type system that enable the lossless encoding of key/value store, document store, wide-column store, graph store, relational store, and other novel or hybrid structures such as hypergraph, docu-graph, and quantum data structures.

The mm-ADT VM enables the intermingling of any language, any processor, and any storage system, that can faithfully implement the core language semantics (__types and values__), processor semantics (__process trace graphs__), and/or storage semantics (__data structure streams__).

=== mm-ADT Theory

==== A Universal Unary Function

Every mm-ADT program denotes a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function[unary function] that maps an `obj` of type \$S\$ (start) to an `obj` of type \$E\$ (end) with the function signature

\[
f: S \rightarrow E.
\]

The complexities of mm-ADT are realized in the definition of an `obj` (which includes both types and values) and the internal structure of an \$f\$-program (which is a composition of nested-functions of arbitrary arity that are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying[curried] at either compile-time or runtime). The sole purpose of this documentation is to make salient the various algebraic structures that are operationalized to ultimately yield the mapping \$f : S \rightarrow E\$.

==== Three Algebraic Actions

[cols="3,3",width=30,float=left]
|===
| Component | Algebra

| Language  | trace ringoid
| Processor | `inst` monoid
| Storage   | `obj` magma
|===

Each of the three aforementioned mm-ADT VM components has an associated algebra that best describes its structures and processes. The *language algebra* is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_monoid[trace] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ringoid] that captures the serial and parallel composition of mm-ADT types. The *processor algebra* (for both compilation and evaluation) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoid] for serially composing instructions from the mm-ADT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture]. Finally, the *storage algebra* is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)[magma] whose carrier set contains all mm-ADT objects and enables various https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action[algebraic actions] that specify the way in which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type[abstract data types] are coupled and controlled by one another (e.g. key/value, graph, relational, etc.).

The primary purpose of this documentation is to explain these algebras, specify their relationship to one another and demonstrate how they are manipulated with mm-ADT technology. Data system engineers will learn how to integrate their technology so end users may compose their work with others' to create _synthetic data systems_ tailored to their problem's particular computational requirements.

=== mm-ADT Technology

==== mm-ADT Console

The mm-ADT VM provides a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop:[REPL] console for users to evaluate mm-ADT programs written in any mm-ADT language.
The reference language distributed with the VM is called `mmlang`. `mmlang` is a low-level, functional language that is in near 1-to-1 correspondence with the underlying VM architecture -- offering it's users https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness[Turing-Complete] expressivity when writing programs and an interactive teaching tool for studying the mm-ADT VM.

==== mmlang Syntax and Semantics

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar[context-free grammar] for `mmlang` is presented below. `mmlang` is best understood as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_algebra[free ringoid] whose elements denote mm-ADT programs which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)[act, as modules,] on the instruction monoid implemented by every mm-ADT processor.

The following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_semantics[language axioms] have variables:

[.small]
[cols="2,1",width=25%,grid=none,frame=none]
|===
| variable | range

| `o1`, `o2`, ...     | `objs`
| `t1`, `t2`, ...     | types
| `v1`, `v2`, ...     | values
| `[a]`, `[b]`, ...   | instructions
| `{q1}`, `{q2}`, ... | quantifiers
|===

[source]
----
id(t1)                    := t1<=t1[id]
domain(t1)                := t1
range(t1)                 := t1
domain(t2<=t1[a])         := t1
range(t2<=t1[a])          := t2
----

The quantifiers of an `mmlang` program are elements of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)[ring with unity] called the _quantifier ring_. In the equations to follow, `*` and `+` refer to the respective monoid and group operations the quantifier ring.

* The `obj` magma juxtapositions, where instructions `[a]`, `[b]`, etc. act as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)[functions] on values and as free monoid concatenation on types. The particulars `objs` that are yielded juxtaposing an `obj` to the left of a type are forthcoming.

t2{q1}<=t1[a][b]      v1{q2}               := v1{q1*q2}
----

* The `inst` instructions denote functions that operate on `objs`. The particular of each instruction is forthcoming. The branch instructions denote flow control operations that mirror the type ringoid where `[compose]` is `*`, `[branch]` is `+`, and `[choose]` is `|`.

v1{q1}[branch,t2{q2}<=t1[a][b],t2{q3}<=t1[a][b]]       := t2{q1*(q2+q3)}<=t1[a][b][c][d](v1)
v1{q1}[choose,t2{q2}<=t1[a][b],t2{q3}<=t1[c][d]]       := t2{q1*q2}<=t1[a][b](v1) | t2{q1*q2}<=t1[c][d](v1)
v1{q1}[repeat,[obj{?}->{0},obj{?}->type,n]]            := ...

* The `polys` are the free algebra of the branch operations encoded in `mmlang` itself. Thus, the `inst` branch rules above are mirrored in the `poly` compositions below.

(t2{q1}<=t1[a][b];t3{q2}<=t2[c][d])  := t3{q1*q2}[a][b][c][d]
(t2{q1}<=t1[a][b],t2{q2}<=t1[c][d])  := t2{q1+q2}<=t1[branch,t2{q1}<=t1[a][b],t2{q1}<=t1[c][d]]
(t2{q1}<=t1[a][b],t2{q2}<=t1[a][b])  := t2{q1+q2}<=t1[a][b]
(t2{q1}<=t1[a][b]|t2{q2}<=t1[c][d])  := t2{min(q1,q2),max(q1,q2)}<=t1[choose,t2{q1}<=t1[a][b],t2{q2}<=t1[c][d]]

* The non-branching `inst` instructions are the functional primitives that are composed to create mm-ADT programs.

o1     bool<=obj[a,o2]          := o1.test(o2)
bool1  bool<=bool[and,bool2]    := bool1 & bool2
o1{q1} int<=obj[count]          := q1
o1     bool<=obj[eq,o2]         := o1 == o2
t1     str<=obj[explain]        ...
...

* The type-oriented `inst` instructions specify the typing rules, where the `_` symbol refers to the __anonymous type__. These equations are presented using the `obj` magma's juxtaposition.
