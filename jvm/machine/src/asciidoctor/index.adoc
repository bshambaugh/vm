mm-ADT integrates a variety of data processing technologies via the distributed mm-ADT virtual machine (mm-ADT VM).

== The mm-ADT Console

The mm-ADT VM is packaged with a REPL console that supports any mm-ADT language. The default language is `mmlang`.

```mmlang
~/software/mm-adt/vm/jvm bin/mmadt.sh
                                _____ _______
                           /\  |  __ |__   __|
 _ __ ___  _ __ ___ _____ /  \ | |  | | | |
| '_ ` _ \| '_ ` _ |_____/ /\ \| |  | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | |   / ____ \ |__| | | |
|_| |_| |_|_| |_| |_|  /_/    \_\____/  |_|
                                 mm-adt.org
mmlang>
```

`mmlang` is in 1-to-1 correspondence with the storage and processing architecture of the mm-ADT VM. As such, `mmlang`
has an assembly language look-and-feel. Fortunately, the mm-ADT VM was designed to easily support other programming
and query languages via the it's `LanguageProvider` interface. Any language that implements `LanguageProvider` can
be used in the mm-ADT console. Furthermore, models can be shared between languages.

```mmlang
mmlang> 1
==>1
mmlang> +2
==>[plus,2]
mmlang> 1+2
==>3
mmlang> 1[plus,2]
==>3
```

== Core Concepts

=== Language, Storage, and Processor

The mm-ADT VM has three primary integration points.

* `LanguageProvider`: Language developers can design custom language or develop parsers for existing languages that
compile to mm-ADT VM bytecode (binary) or unicode (`mmlang` encoding). All mm-ADT languages integrate with the mm-ADT
console.
* `StorageProvider`: Storage systems can be integrated with mm-ADT. mm-ADT's flexible data model and type
system comfortably support key/value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, graph stores, relational stores, and
other novel or hybrid forms such as hypergraphs and docugraph systems.
* `ProcessorProvider`: Processors are any push- or pull-based execution engines. Processors are responsible for
driving the the mm-ADT VM's distributed traverser algorithm on a single-machine in-memory, multi-threaded,
distributed near-time, all the way up to cluster-oriented processors for batch analytics.

The mm-ADT VM enables the intermingling of any language, any storage system, and any processor that can faithfully
implement the core language semantics (types and values), processor semantics (monadic traversers), and/or
storage semantics (streams of atomic and composite data structures).

=== Language Structures

An mm-ADT program is a _type_. It determines a set of `objs`. A canonical type is denoted with a token such as `int`
or `bool`. These canonical types can be constrained and extended using instructions. A complex type definition is
provided below that captures a large number of the mm-ADT type constructs.

```mmadt
int<=int{2}<x>[plus,10]<y>[is.<10 -> <x>
                          |is.<20 -> <y>
                          |int    -> <x>+<y>][count]
```

|Classification          |`mmlang` |Description

|`obj` instruction       |`[ ]`    |The bulk of instructions operate on `objs`.
|traverser instruction   |`< >`    |Traversers are independent computational contexts that can be programmed.
|quantifiers             |`{ }`    |Every `obj` has a quantity as specified by the associated algebraic ring w/ unity.
|branching instructions  |`[->]`   |A `rec` type is used for guarded branching.
|domain/range specifies  |`<=`     |Every type has a domain and a range. Classic types have are endomorphisms.

==== Values and Types

===== Values

There are only two kinds of structures in mm-ADT: _values_ and _types_. Values are the elements of standard data
type sets such as:

* `bool`: two element boolean set containing `true` and `false`.
* `int`: an integer set including positive and negative values (overflow prevention via dynamic bit expansion).
* `real`: a decimal set including positive and negative values (overflow prevention via dynamic bit expansion).
* `str`: the set of all Unicode strings.
* `rec`: a key/value structure supporting arbitrary key and value types.
* `lst`: an ordered list of values support tuple and inductive applications.
* `inst`: an instruction is a `str` opcode and an ordered list of arguments

```mmlang
mmlang> 45[plus,5][plus,[mult,2]]
==>150
mmlang> 'a','b','c'[fold,'seed','',[plus,str<seed>]]
==>'abc'
mmlang> 1,2,3[plus,2]<x>[plus,3]<y>[as,rec['a':int<x>,'b':int<y>]]
==>['a':3,'b':6]
==>['a':4,'b':7]
==>['a':5,'b':8]
mmlang> ['a':['b':['c':['d':0]]]]
==>['a':['b':['c':['d':0]]]]
mmlang> ['a':['b':['c':['d':0]]]].a.b.c.d
==>0
mmlang> .a
==>[get,'a']
```

===== Types

mm-ADT types differ from convention in that they serve to denote:

* *canonical types*: sets of elements denoted as `int` or `str`, etc.
* *refined types*: constraints on the canonical set types such as `nat<=int[is,[gt,0]]`
* *quantified types*: specifying the cardinality of a set via quantification `int{0,5}` (a type of 0 to 5 `int` values).
* *dependent types*:
* *translating types*: specify a mapping from a domain set of elements to a range set of elements as in `int[plus,2]`.
* *recursive types*:




=== Model Categories and their Functors

A _model_ is a set of related types (a type of types). Mathematically, a every mm-ADT model forms a category where
the category _objects_ are the canonical types and the _morphisms_ are types that span the canonical types. All
mm-ADT types respective associative composition and every type's identity morphism is the `[id]` instruction as in
`int<=int[id]`.
