=== Instructions

The mm-ADT VM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] is presented below, where the instructions are ordered by their classification and within each classification, they are ordered alphabetically.

| Class      | Signature                  | Description

| Branch     | `y{*}\<=x[branch]`         | Split `objs` across instructions.
| Filter     | `x{?}\<=x[filter]`         | Remove `objs` from an evaluation
| Flatmap    | `y{*}\<=x[flatmap]`        | Split `objs` across objects.
| Initial    | `obj{0}\<=x[initial]`      | Finalize `objs` in an evaluation
| Map        | `y\<=x[map]`               | Move `objs` between objects
| Reduce     | `y\<=x{*}[reduce]`         | Fold `objs` down to a single `obj`
| SideEffect | `x\<=x[sideeffect]`        | Global state mutations
| Terminal   | `x{*}\<=obj{0}[terminal]`  | Generate `objs` for evaluation
| Trace      | `y\<=x[trace]`             | Traverser the `obj` graph (reflection)

==== Branch Instructions

The branch instruction support the splitting and merging of parallel, data flows, where each branch is a type and, depending on the particular branch instruction, some types, all types, or only those types given a predicate are evaluated.
