== Processor Structures

The programs of the mm-ADT virtual machine are _types_. From a set of canonical types (_ctypes_), derived types (_dtypes_) of arbitrary complexity can be constructed using instructions from the VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture]. Every mm-ADT type has a corresponding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)[diagrammatic] representation that is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism[isomorphic] to a directed labeled *type graph* composed of _type_-vertices and _instruction_-edges.

A program's type graph is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation[intermediate representation] used by the mm-ADT VM to not only link types (encode), but also to compile them (transform/optimize). At execution time, values propagate through the type graph and generate a parallel, homomorphic image of the types as values in the *value graph*, where the resultant structure of an mm-ADT computation is the *obj graph*, where

\[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{q}) + (\texttt{value} \times \texttt{q})
\]

Type composition, compilation, and evaluation are carried out by mm-ADT compliant *processors*. Processors ground the mm-ADT VM to the underlying physical computer (whether on a single machine, via multiple threads, or across compute cluster), where, at the bottom of this _process stack_, the natural world's physics provides the baseline dynamics (the fundamental ground of the computation).

This section details the specifics of the relationships between types, values, and processors.

=== Processes

Processors are used in the following three situations:

. *Composition*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference[type inference]).
. *Compilation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization[type optimization]). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_%28mathematics%29[fix point].
. *Evaluation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)[type enumeration]).


==== Instruction Evaluation

Every mm-ADT instruction denotes a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function[unary function], but mm-ADT instructions themselves may contain zero, one, or multiple sub-expressions as arguments.
At the mm-ADT type-level, mm-ADT instructions are \$n\$-ary computable relations, where through currying and stream semantics, ultimately, unary functions are realized.

===== n-Ary Instructions

Instructions that have no arguments and which map one input to one output are *nullary instructions*.
For example, `[neg]` (negative/negate) is a nullary instruction in the type `int[neg]` denoting the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{neg} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{neg}(x) &\mapsto& -x.
\end{array}
\]

The *unary instruction* `[plus,2]` in `int[plus,2]` is evaluated by the processor as the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{plus_2} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{plus_2}(x) &\mapsto& x + 2. \end{array}
\]

Instructions can have arguments that are dependent on the incoming `obj` (i.e. the unary function argument).
For instance, the unary instruction `[plus,[mult,3]]` in `int[plus,int[mult,3]]` denotes the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{plus_mult_3} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{plus_mult_3}(x) &\mapsto& x + (x * 3).
\end{array}
\]

Finally, as example instruction when the domain and range differ, `[gt,[plus,[id]]]` in \[
\tt{bool<=int[gt,int[plus,int[id]]]} \]
denotes the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{gt_plus_id} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{\texttt{true} \cup \texttt{false}\} \\ \texttt{gt_plus_id}(x) &\mapsto& x > (x + x).
\end{array}
\]

===== n-Ary Relations

==== Instruction Classes

The set `obj` can be partitioned into _types_ and _values_ as \$\tt{obj} = \tt{type} + \tt{value}\$. The type `objs` are the carrier set of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)[ring with unity], where `[compose]` is multiplication (`\*`) , `[branch]` is addition (`+`), `[id]` is the multiplicative identity (`1`), and `[id]{0}` is the the additive identity (`0`). mm-ADT quantifiers also form a ring with unity, where typically the carrier set is `int` and `+` and `*` are standard integer addition and multiplication, respectively.

A variation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_ring[direct product] of rings composes the type ring and the quantifier into a new ring called a https://zenodo.org/record/2565243[stream ring], where the carrier set is the set of all quantified types and `[id]{1}` is the multiplicative identity and `[id]{0}` is the additive identity.
