== Processor Structures

The programs of the mm-ADT virtual machine are _types_. From a set of canonical types (_ctypes_), derived types (_dtypes_) of arbitrary complexity can be constructed using instructions from the VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture]. Every mm-ADT type has a corresponding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)[diagrammatic] representation that is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism[isomorphic] to a directed labeled *type graph* composed of _type_-vertices and _instruction_-edges.

A program's type graph is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation[intermediate representation] used by the mm-ADT VM to not only link types (encode), but also to compile them (transform/optimize). At execution time, values propagate through the type graph and generate a parallel, homomorphic image of the types as values in the *value graph*, where the resultant structure of an mm-ADT computation is the *obj graph*, where

\[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{q}) + (\texttt{value} \times \texttt{q})
\]

Type composition, compilation, and evaluation are carried out by mm-ADT compliant *processors*. Processors ground the mm-ADT VM to the underlying physical computer (whether on a single machine, via multiple threads, or across compute cluster), where, at the bottom of this _process stack_, the natural world's physics provides the baseline dynamics (the fundamental ground of the computation).

This section details the specifics of the relationships between types, values, and processors.

=== Obj Graph

mm-ADT's virtual machine computes via two https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action[actions] on the `obj` graph. When a VM process is at the `obj` \$a\$ and the program (as specified by the type definition) requires the evaluation of `inst` \$i\$, then the VM is in one of two situations.

. The vertex \$a\$ has no outgoing \$i\$ edge. In this situation, the VM _applies_ \$a\$ to \$i\$ to yield the edge \$a \to_i b\$ and arrive at \$b\$ (*compute*).
. The vertex \$a\$ has an outgoing \$i\$ edge. In this situation, the VM _traverses_ the edge \$a \to_i b\$ to arrive at \$b\$ (*memoize*).

The first situation is computing via function https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy[evaluation]. The second situation leverages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization[memoization] to avoid recomputation. There are three ways to best understand the nature of the `obj` graph.

. *Mathematically*: The `obj` graph has an infinite number of `obj` vertices connected to each other by edges labeled from the infinite set instructions in `inst`. From this perspective, computing is traversal (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table[look-up]) as the `obj` graph is fully materialized and thus, memoized.
. *Theoretically*: The `obj` graph is manifested as computations proceed where any binary operation \$ai\$ that has already occurred must already exists in the `obj` graph and thus, can be traversed.
. *Physically*: The `obj` graph is a dynamic entity that expands and contracts given the resource constraints of the underlying physical machines supporting its manifestation across all levels of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy[memory hierarchy], where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)[garbage collection] prunes the graph and computation grows the graph.

=== Processes

Processors are used in the following three situations:

. *Composition*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference[type inference]).
. *Compilation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization[type optimization]). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_%28mathematics%29[fix point]).
. *Evaluation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)[type enumeration]).


==== Instruction Evaluation

Every mm-ADT instruction denotes a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function[unary function], but mm-ADT instructions themselves may contain zero, one, or multiple sub-expressions as arguments.
At the mm-ADT type-level, mm-ADT instructions are \$n\$-ary computable relations, where through currying and stream semantics, ultimately, unary functions are realized.

===== n-Ary Instructions

Instructions that have no arguments and which map one input to one output are *nullary instructions*.
For example, `[neg]` (negative/negate) is a nullary instruction in the type `int[neg]` denoting the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{neg} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{neg}(x) &\mapsto& -x.
\end{array}
\]

The *unary instruction* `[plus,2]` in `int[plus,2]` is evaluated by the processor as the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{plus_2} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{plus_2}(x) &\mapsto& x + 2. \end{array}
\]

Instructions can have arguments that are dependent on the incoming `obj` (i.e. the unary function argument).
For instance, the unary instruction `[plus,[mult,3]]` in `int[plus,int[mult,3]]` denotes the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{plus_mult_3} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\ \texttt{plus_mult_3}(x) &\mapsto& x + (x * 3).
\end{array}
\]

Finally, as example instruction when the domain and range differ, `[gt,[plus,[id]]]` in \[
\tt{bool<=int[gt,int[plus,int[id]]]} \]
denotes the unary function \[
\begin{array}.
\texttt{gt_plus_id} &:& \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{\texttt{true} \cup \texttt{false}\} \\ \texttt{gt_plus_id}(x) &\mapsto& x > (x + x).
\end{array}
\]
