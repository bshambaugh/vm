== Processor Structures

The mm-ADT VM is grounded in a base set of types. Along with the base types, mm-ADT provides a set of instructions and a concise algebra for linking types together via instructions. This graph structure is known as a _type graph_ and forms the internal data structure used by the mm-ADT to represent programs.

It is the role of the processor to evaluate programs composed of types to yield streams composed of values. The primary structure of the processor component of mm-ADT is the *traverser*.

A traverser is the product of an `obj` and a random-access finite map called it's `state`. The traverser's `obj` represents the traverser's current location in the language (types) or storage (values) structure. Within the mm-ADT VM, every `inst` has a respective `apply()`, where \$T\$ is the set of all traversers and \$t,t' \in T\$ are traversers, then the instruction's maps \$t\$ to \$t'\$.
