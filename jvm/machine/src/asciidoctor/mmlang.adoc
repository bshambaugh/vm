=== mmlang Syntax and Semantics

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar[context-free grammar] for `mmlang` is presented below.

[source]
----
obj   := (type | value){q}
type  := ctype | dtype
ctype := bool | int | real | str | rec | inst
q     := int,int
dtype := ctype<=ctype([inst]+)
rec   := [:] | [obj:obj(,obj:obj)*]
inst  := [op(,obj*)]
op    := a, as, branch, choose, plus, mult, is, ...

The following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_semantics[language axioms] have variables `x`, `y`, and `z` in `ctype` and `[a]` and `[b]` in `inst`.

----
id(x)                      := x<=x[id]
domain(y<=x[a])            := x
range(y<=x[a])             := y
domain(x)                  := x
range(x)                   := x
scompose(y<=x[a],z<=y[b])  := z<=x[a][b]
pcompose(y<=x[a],y<=x[b])  := y<=x[branch,y<=x[a],y<=x[b]]
pcompose(y<=x[a],z<=x[b])  := obj<=x[branch,y<=x[a],z<=x[b]]
----

The quantifiers of an `mmlang` program are elements of a ring with unity (the quantifier ring). In the following equations, `*` and `+` refer to the respective monoid and group operations of the program's associated quantifier ring.

scompose(y{q1}<=x[a],z{q2}<=y[b]) := z{q1*q2}<=x[a][b]
pcompose(y{q1}<=x[a],y{q2}<=x[a]) := y{q1+q2}<=x[a]
pcompose(y{q1}<=x[a],y{q2}<=x[b]) := y{q1+q2}<=x[branch,y{q1}<=x[a],y{q2}<=x[b]]
pcompose(y{q1}<=x[a],y{q2}<=x[b]) := obj{q1+q2}<=x[branch,y{q1}<=x[a],z{q2}<=x[b]]

The following inference rules reuse the same variables as the equations above.

xxx   yyy      xxx   yyy

    zz            zz
